## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - I used **HTML5** to layout the basic structure of the site before applying the **Bootstrap** classes/grid layout.

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
    - I used **CSS3** to add custom styles, images and positioning to the HTML elements.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I used **Bootstrap** in my project for it's grid system to create the basic layout of the site. I also used the navbar, modal, buttons, cards and the built-in carousel.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - I used **JQuery** to hide/show the modal when interacting with the form and do a simple validation. It's also used to add/remove classes depending on screen size.
