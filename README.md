# Hercules Gym
User-Centric Frontend Development Project - Code Institute

This is a gym website for new and existing members. It has testamonials from existing members, 
classes currently running at the gym, the gyms address and opening times as well as a contact form for any other queries/information.

## UX
As an existing member, I expect to see currently running classes.
As a new member, I expect to see the gyms address, opening hours.

## Features
 
### Existing Features

### Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to add a seperate section for the payment plans, 
breakdown of the membership and any other commodities the gym provides to it's members.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - I used **HTML5** to layout the basic structure of the site before applying the **Bootstrap** classes/grid layout.

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
    - I used **CSS3** to add custom styles, images and positioning to the HTML elements.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I used **Bootstrap** in my project for it's grid system to create the basic layout of the site. I also used the navbar, modal, buttons, cards and the built-in carousel.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - I used **JQuery** to hide/show the modal when interacting with the form and do a simple validation. It's also used to add/remove classes depending on screen size.

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - My social media icons were from FontAwesome.


## Testing

## Deployment
The website was deployed/hosted on GitHub pages, the following is the process in which i took to deploy it.

#### GitHub Pages

1. On the repo page of the project go to "Settings" tab.
2. Scroll down to GitHub pages.
3. Select "Master Branch" under the source dropdown.
4. A link to the deployed site should show up under the GitHub Pages section.

The master branch should be the root folder with the index.html present for the deployment to work correctly. 
Any changes pushed to GitHub will be updated on the deployed site.
